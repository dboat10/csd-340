        <h1>Brief background</h1>
        <p>
            I believe my inspiration to make this bioSite Project about Angela stems from the fact that I have 
            known her for more than 15 years and she has had a positive impact on my life in several aspects. 
            First, she made me a boyfriend, then funded my very first business idea, then made me a husband and a 
            father. Over the years, I have seen her cry, fail at achieving things she dreamed of at first try but 
            the setbacks did not stop her from going after what she dreamt of achieving.
        </p>
        <p>
            She also made a bold decision to quit her accounting career in the United Kingdom to move to the United 
            States of America to join her husband after marriage during a period of global pandemic. Her courage 
            and determination to make her dreams a reality inspires me to go harder every day to achieve what I 
            want to achieve. Angela's selfless dedication to the well-being of the people in her life is 
            amazing and something that needs to be recognized and celebrated daily. These are some of the 
            inspirations that I drew from Angela to make me better understand her and her daily activities 
            including her hobbies for this web design project. I believe Angela has had a positive influence 
            on the life of her friends and other family members and they would all agree that she is the perfect 
            subject to focus on in this project. I hope that this little gesture of a project will remind her 
            that she is loved and appreciated.

            Hi Angela, it is a priviledge to have you as our subject for this project. 
            <ul>
                <b>Question:</b> <i>Tell us a bit about yourself that we missed in the background story?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> Thank you for this opportunity to be the subject of your bioSite project. As you already 
                    said in your introductory statements, I was born and raised in Ghana in the Western part of Africa. 
                    I am the last born of 3 children and the only girl, so I really enjoyed my childhood. 
                    I moved to the United Kingdom when I was a teenager and lived most of my adult life in London. 
                    I graduated from the University of Manchester with a double degree in Accounting and Finance. 
                    I got married to my childhood sweetheart and move to the United States after marriage.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> In the early stages of my education, I grew an interest in mathematics, 
                    so I wanted to continue and pursue a career that deals with mathematics. I did not have a 
                    lot of white collar professionals in my life, so I did not have any particular career in mind, 
                    I just wanted to be in a mathematics concentrated field. 
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>How would you describe your cultural identity?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> I believe as an African my cultural identity goes back to my heritage and the 
                    folklore of my forefathers. As a child of the Ashanti tribe, I am first an Ashanti, then a 
                    Ghanaian.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>What is your favorite travel destination?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> Growing up away from Ghana, I believe my favorite travel destination is Ghana. 
                    It is always a pleasure when I get the chance to travel back home, the nostalgic feeling of 
                    being back to where I grew up, the noisy environment of cars honking, the busy streets of 
                    Kumasi and Accra, eating highly organic meals free from chemicals, Ghana is clearly my favorite 
                    travel destination.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>What is your highest level of education?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting and Finance from the University 
                    of Manchester in the United Kingdom.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>What do you do for a living?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> I am currently a Financial Analyst for Black Knight Financial Services in 
                    Jacksonville, Florida in the United States of America.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>How would you describe your career in three words?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> It is STRESSFULL!!!
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>You mentioned that you married your childhood sweetheart? Who is your spouse?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> Yes, I have been married for 3 years to Oscar Acheampong. We met when we were young
                     in Ghana, I believe around the ages of 18 or 19 and here we are today.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>Do you have children? What are their names and ages?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> I have 1 bundle of joy called Cherelle Acheampong, she turns 2 on August 1st and 
                    she is awesome.
                </p>

                <b>Question:</b> <i>Are you a sports fan? If yes, what is your favorite team?</i>
                <p>
                    <b>Answer:</b> I am not a sports fan, but my husband is a big time football fan, I am from the UK 
                    so the only football I know is the one played with the foot, not the American football played 
                    with the hands. Anyways my husband supports Liverpool Football Club in the English Premier League,
                    so I play the devil's advocate and supports their bitter rivals, Manchester United just to get 
                    him annoyed on game days.
